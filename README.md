## Hi there 👋

Tech Lead & Backend Specialist

🌟 With over a decade of experience in software development, I've honed my skills in creating robust, scalable, and maintainable backend systems. My core expertise lies in PHP, Go, Python, and C#, but I'm always eager to explore new technologies and frameworks.

🚀 As a Tech Lead, I focus on driving development projects to success, ensuring our code is reliable, readable, and efficient. I thrive on challenges and believe in continuous learning to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

🔧 I have a passion for Kubernetes and leveraging its power to streamline deployment and scaling processes. My interest in IoT and smart technologies keeps me excited about the future of connected devices and their potential to transform our lives.

🎨 While my heart beats for backend technologies, I also enjoy dabbling in Angular for frontend development, bringing a well-rounded perspective to my projects.

🏃‍♂️ Outside of coding, I'm a passionate sports enthusiast, always eager to take on new physical challenges. I have a deep interest in calisthenics, enjoying the simplicity and effectiveness of bodyweight exercises. I'm also a strong advocate for data-driven health care, using technology and data analysis to optimize my fitness routines and overall well-being. Whether it's tracking performance metrics or exploring the latest in health tech innovations, I believe in leveraging data to enhance health and fitness outcomes.

🇯🇵 I am deeply fascinated by Japanese culture and language, and I strive to incorporate Japanese philosophies like Kaizen (continuous improvement), Ikigai (finding purpose), and Ichigo Ichie (cherishing the moment) into my daily life and coding practices. These principles help me maintain a balanced, fulfilling, and productive lifestyle.
